## 🏫 Multi-School Management Example

**Use Case**: Ryan Group of International Schools
- **Cambridge High School** (ICSE board, K-12, Andheri campus)
- **St. Lawrence High School** (CBSE board, K-10, Bandra campus)
- **Ryan International** (CBSE board, K-12, Goregaon campus)

**Why School Name and Board are critical:**
1. **Attendance Reports**: Must show school-wise absentees
2. **WhatsApp Alerts**: Must include correct school name in message
3. **Fee Collection**: Separate accounts per school
4. **UDISE Upload**: Each school has unique UDISE code
5. **Performance Analytics**: Compare across schools within group
6. **Board-Specific Operations**: 
   - CBSE schools follow 10-point grading
   - ICSE schools use percentage system
   - Different exam schedules (CBSE Annual vs ICSE Semester)

---

## 🎯 Field Configuration in System

Use the **Field Builder** (`/fields` page) to:
1. **Enable/Disable Fields**: Turn off unused fields (e.g., health tracking)
2. **Mark Required**: Set which fields must be filled
3. **Reorder Fields**: Customize display order in upload preview
4. **Add Descriptions**: Help text for field clarification

**Default Configuration (V11)**:
- ✅ Class, Division, Sub-Division: **Enabled** (essential)
- ✅ School Name, Board, Academic Year: **Enabled** (V12)
- ❌ Allergies, Immunization, Height, Weight, Vision: **Disabled** (rarely used)

## 📝 Data Entry Best Practices

### For School Administrators:
1. **Start with P0 fields**: Get basics right first (ID, name, class, contacts)
2. **Fill P1 during admission**: Collect APAAR, category, address at admission time
3. **P2 can wait**: Documents can be uploaded later, don't delay admission
4. **Ignore P3**: System calculates fees/attendance automatically
5. **Enable health fields only if needed**: Don't burden data entry staff

### For Management Groups:
1. **Standardize School Names**: Use consistent names across all uploads
   - ✅ Good: "Cambridge High School", "Ryan International High School"
   - ❌ Bad: "Cambridge HS", "Cambridge", "CHS" (inconsistent)
2. **Always specify Board**: Even if all schools are CBSE, explicitly mention it
3. **Use Academic Year format**: `2024-2025` not `2024` or `24-25`
4. **Separate uploads per school**: Easier to verify and audit
